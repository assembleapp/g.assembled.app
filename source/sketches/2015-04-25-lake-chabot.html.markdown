First free weekend in a while, so I hit up an art store before biking out to
Lake Chabot in the East Bay. I was originally planning on drawing a landscape,
but the bench that I parked my bike on had a lot of character.

It's remarkable the difference that good equipment can make.
This was my first drawing with pens actually designed for drawing, on paper
that was meant for more than just notes.

I'm not super-thrilled about how the back wheel looks, but overall I think
it turned out well.
