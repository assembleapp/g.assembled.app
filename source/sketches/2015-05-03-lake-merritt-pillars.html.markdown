I met a couple friends over in Oakland to sketch near Lake Merritt.
On the north side of the lake, a path of pillars runs in a semicircle
around the border of the lake. In the middle is this open-air structure.

This was my first time using watercolor pencils -
or color of any kind - in my drawings.

I like the play of the strong lines from the pen,
and the gentle gradients of watercolor.
I'll have to play with it more to find a combination I really like.
