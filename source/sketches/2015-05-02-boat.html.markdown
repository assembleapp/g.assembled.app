This boat was full of people tailgating near AT&T Park during a Giants game.

The picture doesn't capture the original scene too well,
other than the basic structure of the boat.

In real life, the boat was much longer - the proportions got stretched a bit,
probably because the wind kept changing the angle that I saw the boat from.

The boat also started out white, but my sad attempts at putting texture on the
hull forced me to eventually fill it in much darker.
