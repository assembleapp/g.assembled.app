More experimentation with watercolor pencils.

This time, I tried to do the foreground in black-and-white with pen,
and fill out the colors of the background in watercolor.

I liked it when I started out with the sky and the mountains,
but I think the lack of detail in watercolors made me a bit lazy by the time
I got to the water and the grass.

The midground was a bit of an afterthought,
and in retrospect I probably should have left it out.
