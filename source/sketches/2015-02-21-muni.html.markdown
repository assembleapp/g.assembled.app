The view out of a restaurant window, drawn with a waiter's pen.
This is the southwest corner of the 24th & Mission MUNI stop,
with the entrance to the underground BART station behind it.

Unfortunately, I didn't have my camera with me.
I had to take a terribly blurry shot with my phone to give some context.
