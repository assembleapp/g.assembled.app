This is the view from behind the De Young art museum, in SF's Golden Gate Park.
The oddly-shaped tower makes it a more interesting subject
than most other architecture I've drawn.

I stopped to sketch this after visiting
Keith Haring's exhibit, *[The Political Line]*.

You might say the exhibit inspired me.
Not inspired enough to draw [hundreds of penises],
but enough to draw the building that contained them.
