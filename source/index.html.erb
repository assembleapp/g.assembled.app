<h1>Grayson Wright</h1>
<p>I'm a web developer and designer currently working
at <a href="https://thoughtbot.com">thoughtbot</a> in San Francisco.
I recently finished studying computer science
at <a href="http://cse.msu.edu">MSU</a>,
where I researched digital evolution
at the <a href="http://beacon-center.org/">BEACON</a> center
and helped the startups <a href="http://temporunapp.com">TempoRun</a>
and <a href="http://carboncash.co">Carbon Cash</a> build their web services.
</p>

<p>I'm passionate about teaching programming, talking at conferences,
and writing software that solves real problems.
I love good conversations with good people over good food and good beer.
