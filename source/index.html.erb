<p>
I'm a web developer and designer currently working
at <a href="https://thoughtbot.com">thoughtbot</a> in San Francisco.
In my spare time, I help build solutions to social problems
at <a href="http://codeforsanfrancisco.org/">Code for SF</a>.
</p>

<p>
Until recently I studied computer science at <a href="http://cse.msu.edu">MSU</a>,
where I researched digital evolution
at the <a href="http://beacon-center.org/">BEACON</a> center
and helped the startups <a href="http://temporunapp.com">TempoRun</a>
and <a href="http://carboncash.co">Carbon Cash</a> build their web services.
</p>

<p>
I'm passionate about teaching programming, talking at conferences,
and writing software that solves real problems.
