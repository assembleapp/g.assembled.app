# Administrate
(in progress; not yet released)

### What is it?

Every Friday at thoughtbot, we take a break from client work to spend the day
on internal tools, products, and open source libraries.
For the last several months,
I've been the lead developer on Administrate -
a library that helps developers set up a useful and intuitive admin dashboard
for any Ruby on Rails app.

### Why?

This project grew out of observing my clients' and coworkers' frustrations with
existing tools.
While several other admin dashboard libraries exist,
the existing solutions often make it difficult for users
to find information they're using for,
and challenging for developers to customize beyond the default behavior.

    Existing Rails admin dashboards have clunky interfaces
    and are exceptionally difficult for developers to customize.

    <blockquote>
    Administrate follows common conventions -
    both for its user interface and the underlying code -
    to make it easy for developers to customize
    and even easier for users to understand.
    </blockquote>

One of the things that drew me to this project is that,
unlike most open-source projects,
Administrate's interface will be used by non-technical people.
The goal is to design an interface both general enough
to be used in any Rails app,
and intuitive enough for non-technical admins to be productive with it.

### Process

From the beginning, I wanted the project to be user-driven.
Before writing a single line of code,
I watched coworkers work with the existing libraries to find pain points.
Shortly after, I created several iterations of prototypes and collected feedback
to validate my assumptions about the project.

I'm working with designers at thoughtbot
to improve the visual design and user experience.
In the next few weeks,
we'll ask nontechnical users to walk through the interface as we watch
so we can identify areas that need work.
