## Behavior Hacking

In an attempt to force myself to write more,
I created a small blog with a special twist.

The main feature of the blog
was a 1-week countdown timer that reset every time I posted something new.
If I ever went more than one week without posting anything,
the timer would run out and everything I had posted would be deleted.

The blog was successful at getting me to write weekly,
but I discovered that the deadline constraint didn't leave me room
to write the kinds of posts I really wanted to.
I ended up posting many short pieces,
instead of the longform pieces I had hoped to work on.
