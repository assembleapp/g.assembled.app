# San Francisco OpenReferral

Lead Developer | 2015 | [View Source]

## What is it?

In 2015 as part of [Code for San Francisco],
I worked with the OpenReferral team
to collect and distribute
information about social service organizations
in and around San Francisco.

Although the OpenReferral movement has groups
in many cities across the country,
the San Francisco group has a local focus;
help the [SF Reentry Council]
collect, maintain, and distribute
the information in their biannual publication,
the [Guide to Getting Out and Staying Out].

      managed in MS Word.

Every year,
an enormous amount of work goes into collecting and verifying
the information in the Reentry Council's guidebook.
The work is done mostly by hand,
and without any communication with other groups
doing similar work.
Our web app helps the Reentry Council
manage and verify the information they collect,
and combine it with other public data sources
to improve the quality of their information.

## My Role

For the year that I worked on the project,
I was the lead developer on the team.
I spend a lot of time
onboarding and coordinating the efforts of several volunteers,
in addition to standard development work.
I advocated for and led user testing and group design exercises -
both have had big impacts on the direction of the project.

## Process

With a lot of volunteer churn
and very limited time constraints (three hours per week),
one of our biggest challenges
has been keeping momentum strong on the project.

To combat this, we schedule in regular user feedback.
The feedback helps both to validate our product design ideas
and to keep us driven and focused on the most important user-facing tasks.
