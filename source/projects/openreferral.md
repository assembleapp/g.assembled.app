# San Francisco OpenReferral

Lead Developer | [Open Source] | [Visit Site]

## What is it?

Every Wednesday night as part of [Code for San Francisco],
I work with the OpenReferral team
to collect and distribute
information about social service organizations
in and around San Francisco.

Although the OpenReferral movement has groups
in many cities across the country,
our group has a local focus:
Help the [SF Reentry Council]
collect, maintain, and distribute
the information in their biannual publication,
the [Guide to Getting Out and Staying Out].

Every year,
an enormous amount of work goes into collecting and verifying
the information in the Reentry Council's guidebook.
The work is done mostly by hand,
and without any communication with other groups
doing similar work.
Our web app helps the Reentry Council
manage and verify the information they collect,
and combine it with other public data sources
to improve the quality of their information.

## My Role

Since I joined the project in January,
I've been the lead developer on the team.
I spend a lot of time
onboarding and coordinating the efforts of several volunteers,
in addition to standard development work.

I've also been able to apply some of my consulting experience
to the project.
Over the past few months, I've advocated strongly for user testing
and group design exercises -
both have had big impacts on the direction of the project.

## Process

With a lot of volunteer churn
and very limited time constraints (three hours per week),
one of our biggest challenges
has been keeping momentum strong on the project.

To combat this, we schedule in regular user feedback.
The feedback helps both to validate our product design ideas
and to keep us driven and focused on the most important user-facing tasks.

After talking a couple times
with users from the Reentry Council team,
we decided that the app we started with
(based on DC's OpenReferral project)
was too general to be useful for managing the guidebook.
Over the last two months
we've cut out many unnecessary features
to focus on the most important use case
for the Reentry council.

We still have some work to do before we release the app to the wild,
but the user-driven process ensures we're on the fastest route to get there.
