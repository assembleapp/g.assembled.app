teaser: Administrate is an open-source tool for creating user-friendly and developer-friendly admin dashboards in Rails apps.  I was the lead developer on the project and took the library from concept to launch, with several rounds of user testing along the way.

## What is it?

During my time at thoughtbot
I was the lead developer on Administrate -
a library that helps developers set up a useful and intuitive admin dashboard
for any Ruby on Rails app.

## Why?

The project grew out of observing my clients' and coworkers' frustrations with
existing Rails admin dashboards.
While several other options exist,
they often made it difficult for users to find information they're using for,
and challenging for developers to customize beyond the default behavior.

    Existing Rails admin dashboards have clunky interfaces
    and are exceptionally difficult for developers to customize.
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
    Administrate follows common conventions -
    both for its user interface and the underlying code -
    to make it easy for developers to customize
    and even easier for users to understand.
    </blockquote>
  </aside>
</div>

One of the things that drew me to this project is that,
unlike most open-source projects,
Administrate's interface is used by non-technical people.
The goal was to design an interface both general enough
to be used in any Rails app,
and intuitive enough for non-technical admins to be productive with it.

## Process

From the beginning the project was driven by user testing and feedback.
Before writing a single line of code,
I watched coworkers work with the existing libraries to find pain points.
While developing,
I created several iterations of prototypes
and collected feedback to validate my assumptions about the project.
