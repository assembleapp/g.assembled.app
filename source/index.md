I'm a developer and designer currently working at [thoughtbot] in San Francisco.
In my spare time, I help build solutions to social problems at [Code for SF].

Until recently I studied computer science at [MSU],
where I researched digital evolution at the [BEACON] center
and helped the startups [TempoRun] and [Carbon Cash] build their web services.

I'm passionate about teaching programming, talking at conferences,
and writing software that solves real problems.
Get in touch with me by [email] â€“ I'd love to chat.
You can also find me on [github] and [twitter].
