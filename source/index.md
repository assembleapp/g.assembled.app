I'm an application designer and developer
currently working on a project called Assemble.

As a fellow at [Code for America][cfa] in 2016,
I helped build
[a tool to help the Seattle Police Department deliver better care][ridealong]
to people with mental illness in their community.

Before that I worked as a consultant at [thoughtbot] in San Francisco,
building a wide range of web applications for startups and large businesses.

I studied computer science at [Michigan State University][MSU],
where I researched digital evolution at the [BEACON] center
and helped the startups [TempoRun] and [Carbon Cash] build their web services.

I'm passionate about teaching programming,
talking at conferences,
and writing software that solves real problems.
Get in touch with me by [email] â€“ I'd love to chat.
You can also find me on [github] and [twitter].
