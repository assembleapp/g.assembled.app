I'm a developer and designer
currently working at [Code for America],
building [a tool to help the Seattle Police Department deliver better care][app]
to people with mental illnesses and chemical dependencies
in their community.

Before that I worked as a consultant at [thoughtbot] in San Francisco,
building a wide range of web applications for startups and large businesses.

I studied computer science at [Michigan State University][MSU],
where I researched digital evolution at the [BEACON] center
and helped the startups [TempoRun] and [Carbon Cash] build their web services.

I'm passionate about teaching programming,
talking at conferences,
and writing software that solves real problems.
Get in touch with me by [email] â€“ I'd love to chat.
You can also find me on [github] and [twitter].
